# Multi-Spec — Pre-flight Verify Sweep

Loaded by `multi-spec.md`'s "Pre-flight Verify Sweep" section — it lives here rather than inline
because `multi-spec.md` sits at its 20,480-byte read budget (#3360).

Before spec 1's pipeline begins — after the shared worktree exists and is checked out (`worktree` mode), or in the current checkout otherwise — run `test/verification.md` Steps 1-2 (type check, lint, tests) **once** against the unmodified base, before any spec's build touches the code.

Why: without this, each of N specs independently re-diagnoses the same pre-existing failure from scratch — every spec's own `/test` step re-derives the same root cause, with no shared record since the only trace lives in gitignored report files.

Record any failures as ledger items in the **parent** run directory (not a per-spec subdir): phase `test`, status `open`, description naming the failing check and its root cause if apparent. If the sweep finds zero failures, skip the ledger write and proceed silently — do not add a "sweep clean" entry.

This does not replace each spec's own `/test` gate — every spec still runs verification normally. It establishes the baseline so a spec whose `/test` run hits a failure already recorded here cites the existing ledger entry (`Pre-existing — see ledger #{N}, batch pre-flight sweep`) instead of re-diagnosing it, per `test/verification.md`'s "Pre-existing failures (multi-spec batches)" note.
